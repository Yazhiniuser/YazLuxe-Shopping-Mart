              # YazLuxe-Shopping-Mart
            e-commerce website using backend 
            
I developed Shopping Mart, a simple yet functional e-commerce web application using Java (JSP & Servlet) for backend development and MySQL Workbench for database management. This project was built as part of my learning journey in full-stack Java web development.

🛠️ Tech Stack

•	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (basic styling)

•	Backend: Java (JSP, Servlet)

•	Database: MySQL (via MySQL Workbench)

•	Server: Apache Tomcat
